# Security Policy

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in Udas (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can reach us at rayan.m.haddad@icloud.com

You should not report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing Udas's users to increased risk.
